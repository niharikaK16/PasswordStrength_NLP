# Password Strength Prediction using NLP

This project aims to predict the strength of passwords using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves data cleaning, semantic analysis, feature engineering, and applying machine learning algorithms for prediction.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is performed to preprocess the password data, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing the format.

## Semantic Analysis

Semantic analysis techniques are applied to extract meaningful insights from the password data, such as identifying common patterns, word frequencies, and linguistic characteristics.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves transforming the password data into meaningful features that can be used for modeling. Techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are applied to extract features from text data.

## Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the distribution of password strengths and identify any patterns or correlations in the data.

## Applying Feature Importance

Feature importance techniques are applied to identify the most informative features for predicting password strength.

## Applying Machine Learning algorithm on Data

Machine learning algorithms are applied to the password data to train models for predicting password strength. Various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods may be explored.

## Doing Prediction on Sample Data

Predictions are made on sample password data to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

## Checking Accuracy of Model

The accuracy of the trained models is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
